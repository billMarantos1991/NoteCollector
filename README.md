# NoteCollector
Android Music Game for my thesis

The game operates with the use of MIDI files information which generates the objects collected by the player.
The user of the game initially selects a track and after adjusting the desired difficulty level he switches to the main screen where the game begins. The player is able to enter and see the recorded scores. Furthermore, he has the option to make some personal settings. It is worth noting that the game is designed for piano music tracks, but it also operates with tracks of any other musical instrument always in MIDI file.
